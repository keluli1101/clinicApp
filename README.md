Doctor Appointment Booking Android App3
Leveraging a variety of programming tools, including Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite, Firebase Realtime
Database, and Android Studio, an application was developed to enable users to log in as either 'Doctor' or 'Patient.' The
app includes a doctor's introduction page and a booking system that allows patients to make and adjust appointments.
The project was hosted on Github and was successfully completed as a group effort. This demonstrates strong skills in
developing robust, user-centric mobile applications that can effectively manage complex data and user interactions.
